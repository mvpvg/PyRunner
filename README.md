A self-hosted Python script automation platform. Upload a script, schedule it, monitor it — nothing else to configure.

## Features

- **Script Management** — Create, edit, and organize Python scripts from your browser
- **Flexible Scheduling** — Run scripts manually, at intervals, or on a daily / weekly / monthly schedule (timezone-aware)
- **Virtual Environments** — Isolated Python environments with custom pip packages per script
- **Run History & Logs** — Track every execution with stdout/stderr capture
- **Secrets Management** — Store encrypted environment variables and secrets
- **AI for Scripts** — Call AI from your scripts using your Claude subscription, an Anthropic API key, or other providers (Z.AI GLM, OpenRouter, local Ollama, any Anthropic-compatible endpoint) — with saved provider profiles and one-click switching
- **Notifications** — Get alerts via email, webhook, or Telegram on script completion/failure
- **Invite-Only Auth** — Admin-invited accounts with email + password login and email-based reset (no open registration)
- **Single Container** — Deploy with one Docker command

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hassancs91/PyRunner.git
cd PyRunner

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Start PyRunner
docker compose up -d

```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Using Docker Hub Image

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pyrunner \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v pyrunner_data:/app/data \
  -e DEBUG=False \
  -e ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost \
  hasanaboulhasan/pyrunner:latest
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | **Required** | Django secret key (container exits if unset — see [.env.example](.env.example)) |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | **Required** | Fernet key for encrypting stored secrets — save this somewhere safe |
| `DEBUG` | `False` | Debug mode (disable in production) |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Allowed hostnames |
| `Q_WORKERS` | `2` | Background task workers |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all options.

## AI in your scripts

PyRunner can run AI directly inside your Python scripts so your automations can
research, summarize, and reason. It works with **your own** account on any of
several providers — profiles are saved (keys encrypted) so you can switch the
active provider with one click:

| Provider | Credential | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Claude subscription token or API key | Full experience incl. **web search/fetch** tools |
| **Z.AI (GLM)** | Z.AI API key | GLM models via Z.AI's Anthropic-compatible endpoint; strong tool-calling |
| **OpenRouter** | OpenRouter API key | Hundreds of models; ids are namespaced (`deepseek/deepseek-chat`) |
| **Ollama (local)** | none needed | Local models, requires Ollama ≥ 0.14; from Docker use `http://host.docker.internal:11434` |
| **Custom** | your token | Any Anthropic-compatible endpoint (LiteLLM proxy, llama.cpp server, …) |

> **A note on subscription auth:** this is intended for *self-hosters using their
> own Claude subscription for their own automations* — equivalent to running
> Claude Code headless on your own machine. Anthropic's Agent SDK terms restrict
> *offering* claude.ai login to other people as part of a product/SaaS; don't use
> a shared or pooled subscription to serve multiple end-users.

### Setup

1. **Add a provider** under **Services → AI Provider**:
   - Pick a provider type — the endpoint URL and hints fill in automatically —
     then paste your credential and optionally set a default model.
   - For an Anthropic subscription token, run `claude setup-token` on a machine
     where you're logged into Claude, then paste the result.
   - **Save**, make sure it's the **active** provider, and hit **Test** —
     Anthropic runs a real web search; other providers run a real tool-call
     round-trip, so you also learn whether your chosen model handles tools
     reliably before wiring it into automations.
   - Tick **Enable AI for scripts** and save the settings.
2. **Install the SDK** into the Environment your script uses:
   Environments → *(your env)* → Packages → add `claude-agent-sdk`.
   (The Claude Code CLI itself ships with the PyRunner Docker image.)

### Use it

```python
from pyrunner_ai import ask_claude

# Web search + fetch are on by default
answer = ask_claude("Search the web for today's top AI story and summarize it")
print(answer)

# Restrict tools, pick a model, add a system prompt
summary = ask_claude(
    "Summarize https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/",
    tools=["WebFetch"],
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
)

# Full details (tools used, cost, turns)
result = ask_claude("Research the latest Django release", raw=True)
print(result.text, result.tools_used, result.cost_usd)

# Stream the answer
from pyrunner_ai import stream_claude
for chunk in stream_claude("Write a short poem about automation"):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)

# Lean mode: only load the tools you ask for (cuts ~50k cached tokens/call)
answer = ask_claude("Search the web for today's AI news", lean=True)
```

Available tools: `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`. File-writing
and shell tools (`Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`) are **off by default** for safety —
scripts run with full access to the PyRunner host, so only enable those if you
fully trust the prompt.

Scripts always use the **active provider**. Two provider-specific caveats:
`WebSearch`/`WebFetch` are Anthropic server-side tools and don't exist on other
providers, and agentic tool-calling quality varies by model — the per-provider
**Test** button checks exactly that, and frontier-class or GLM-4.7+ models are
recommended for tool-heavy scripts and Py AI.

**A note on token counts:** an agentic call carries the agent's tool definitions
as context, sent once and **prompt-cached** — that's the large "cache tokens"
figure on the usage page, not your content. Pass `lean=True` to define only the
tools you requested and slash that overhead. The connection test always runs
lean.
