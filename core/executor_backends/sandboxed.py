SandboxedSubprocessBackend — fs/network isolation on top of the local spawn.

This is the optional top layer of FOUNDATIONS Seam 2 (sandbox Stage 2b). It is
``LocalSubprocessBackend`` with the script command wrapped by an auto-detected
process sandboxer (bubblewrap preferred, nsjail supported) so the run gets a
private mount namespace (host filesystem read-only, nothing writable but a
scratch dir) on top of the rlimits floor and the existing process-group /
timeout-kill / pid lifecycle — those are inherited unchanged from the local
backend, since the sandbox is just a command prefix.

Degrades, never collapses
-------------------------
Process sandboxers need unprivileged user namespaces, which many hosts (and the
default Docker seccomp profile) block. So the backend re-detects capability at
run time (the real enforcement; the dashboard cache is only a convenience gate)
and, when the host can't deliver a full sandbox, **falls back to the plain local
spawn (still with rlimits)** rather than failing the run. Protection drops a
tier — nsjail/bwrap+rlimits -> rlimits-only -> plain — it never drops to nothing.

Datastore under sandbox
-----------------------
On SQLite the datastore helper reads ``PYRUNNER_DB_PATH`` directly. Binding that
file back into the sandbox would re-open the cross-tenant raw-read hole the
sandbox exists to close, so when actually sandboxing we **drop
``PYRUNNER_DB_PATH`` from the run env** — the helper then transparently uses the
loopback internal API (``PYRUNNER_INTERNAL_URL`` + token, which the executor
already injects). Network is shared (not unshared) so the loopback API and
ordinary outbound calls keep working; strict egress is a later stage.
