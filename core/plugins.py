"""
PyRunner plugin system — registry, the plugin contract, and the safe AppConfig.

This module is the public *contract* a plugin author codes against. It is kept
deliberately light: importing it must never require the Django app registry to
be ready, and it must never import any plugin code. Deciding *what* is active and
*importing it guarded* lives in ``pyrunner/settings.py`` and ``pyrunner/urls.py``
so that a broken plugin can never take down core.

Safety note: plugins register themselves from their ``AppConfig.ready()``, which
is wrapped so a registration error is swallowed on the live server (the plugin
simply doesn't appear) but *re-raised* inside the isolated ``plugin_preflight``
subprocess (env ``PYRUNNER_PLUGIN_PREFLIGHT=1``) so the plugin can be quarantined
before the real server ever loads it.

    A plugin's ``apps.py`` subclasses this and sets ``plugin`` to a

    Registration is guarded so that on the live server a broken plugin never
    crashes app population — *except* inside the preflight subprocess, where we
    deliberately let the failure surface so the plugin can be quarantined before
    the real server ever loads it.

    AppConfig discovery note: a plugin's apps.py naturally does
    ``from core.plugins import PluginAppConfig``, which makes BOTH this base and
    the plugin's own subclass visible in that module. Django's auto-discovery
    picks the single AppConfig candidate, so we exclude this base from being a
    candidate (``default = False``) while marking every subclass as one
    (``__init_subclass__`` sets ``default = True``). Without this, Django finds
    two candidates, gives up, and silently falls back to a plain AppConfig — so
    the plugin's ready()/descriptor would never run.
