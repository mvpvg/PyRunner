"""
Host sandbox capability probe (FOUNDATIONS Seam 2, sandbox Stage 2).

PyRunner ships to many self-hosted environments, so the filesystem/network
sandbox can't be a maintainer pre-build gate — its availability is *detected at
runtime per instance*. This module is the single probe used by all three call
sites that need it:

- ``manage.py sandbox_check`` (CLI),
- the dashboard **"Test sandbox on this host"** button (Settings → Isolation),
- worker-side runtime detection before a sandboxed run (the real enforcement;
  the UI gate is only convenience).

The probe answers one question — which protection *tier* can this host actually
deliver — and degrades honestly:

    full          posix + an nsjail/bwrap binary + a minimal unprivileged-userns
                  sandbox actually runs here.
    rlimits_only  posix (so ``setrlimit`` works) but no usable fs/net sandbox
                  (no binary, or userns/seccomp blocks it).
    none          not even rlimits (non-POSIX host, e.g. the Windows dev box).

Tiers degrade *independently*: losing the fs/net sandbox never loses rlimits —
the executor falls back a tier, never to "no protection". The probe is cheap,
side-effect-free, and re-runnable (capability can change on redeploy).

# Preference order: nsjail is batteries-included (mount + seccomp + netns +

# first — its "validated wrapper". The two orders diverge ONLY on a host with BOTH
# binaries installed (uncommon; the official image ships bubblewrap only), where the
# probe would validate nsjail while a run uses bwrap. Left as-is deliberately: the
# probe answers "can this host sandbox at all?" and surfaces the tool it validated in
# its result detail; forcing the orders to match is a design call on this locked,
