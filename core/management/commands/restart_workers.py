"""
Management command to restart qcluster workers.

Sends SIGTERM to the worker recorded in the PID file; the entrypoint's monitor
loop (entrypoint.sh) notices the death within ~5s and starts a fresh worker.
Success is confirmed ONLY by the PID file changing to a new, live PID — a
worker heartbeat is NOT proof (the old worker can still heartbeat while dying,
which is exactly how this command used to report false successes).
