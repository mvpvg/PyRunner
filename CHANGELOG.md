# Changelog

All notable changes to PyRunner are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The authoritative version number lives in `pyrunner/version.py`. This changelog
begins tracking at the current release; earlier history is in the git log.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared cache backend: `DatabaseCache` by default (no extra service), with an
  opt-in `REDIS_URL` to use Redis. Fixes rate-limiting and webhook dedup that
  previously used a per-process cache and were not shared across workers.
- `HEALTHCHECK` in the `Dockerfile` (mirrors docker-compose) so `docker run`
  users also get container health reporting.
- Brotli-compressed static assets via WhiteNoise (`.br` in addition to gzip).

### Changed
- Expanded `.env.example` to document the previously-undocumented settings
  (HSTS, DB connection age, gunicorn/PORT, login/API rate limits, per-run
  resource limits).

## [1.13.0]
